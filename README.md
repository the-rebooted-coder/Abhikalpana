## SANITISATION FACILITY
### CADAction Model
##### Jaypee University of Engineering & Technology

**Sanitary Tunnel** is a tested, safe, and effective
method to sanitize people and objects in just 5
seconds, killing up to **99% of any pathogenic
microbes on the surfaces, including COVID-19.**
The sanitizing method of Sanitary Tunnel consists in
nebulizing **_‘Drava’_**, a hydroalcoholic sanitizing
solution pumped through a high precision system
integrated inside a ribbed aluminium tunnel.

>The tunnel retains the atomized sanitizing product

which saturates the environment. In this way, it is
possible to disinfect all surfaces, even in the most
hidden places.
The system can nebulize sanitizing solutions in a
concentrated formula or can be diluted with water
from the mains.
